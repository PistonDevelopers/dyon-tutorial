# Introduction

Welcome to the Dyon tutorial!

Dyon is a dynamically typed scripting language,
designed for game engines and interactive applications.
It was started in 2016 by Sven Nilsen.

This tutorial is written for people with little experience
with programming.
If you are experienced programmer, you might want to skip to the parts that interests you.

### Dyon is different!

Dyon introduces a different way of thinking about solving problems, which some people might need some time to get used to.
It is recommended to practice with each new idea one at a time.

The language takes ideas from Javascript, Go and Rust, but focuses on practical features for games:

- Optional type system with ad-hoc types
- Similar object model to Javascript, but without `null`
- Built-in support for 4D vectors, HTML hex colors
- Go-like coroutines

There are plenty of new ideas in Dyon:

- Lifetime checker for arguments
- Use `return` as local variable
- Mathematical loops
- Current objects
- Secrets
- Grab expressions
- Dynamic modules as a way of organizing code

### How this tutorial is organized

Each chapter tells how to do something step by step.

At the bottom there is a "Comments" section.
This contains things you might have noticed and things you can try out on your own.

### Source code

You will find the source code for all examples under "examples" in the git repository.
